        ~ (<i>tilde</i>) is a sandbox that allows to easily make micro-games for friends, and with friends without having to use Roblox Studio.

        I wanted to find a game where users' creativity wouldn't be limited by available tools, and by their complexity. 
        Roblox was a perfect platform for this, as it allows to model complex shapes and change the behaviour of them using scripts, 
        but Roblox Studio disallowed simultaneously playing the games and creating them, and it was hard to use for some people, 
        so I decided to make this game.
